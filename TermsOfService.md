<br>

## Definitions

The section describes basic definitions that will be used in further parts of the agreement.

<br>

**1) AUTHOR** - the website developer and owner (Kamil Marciniak, also known as Martimex / MTX)

**2) USER** - a person who completed the registration process for the website and accepted the Terms of Service beforehand

**3) APPLICATION / WEBSITE** - the Flash Memory website (accessible from: https://flash-memory.vercel.app/), including the logo and all contained content 

**4) ACCOUNT** - a virtual property, which indirectly belongs to the User. It is mandatory to set up in order to use the Application. The ultimate owner of every
Account is the Author, who has the right to suspend or terminate the Account within a sensible reason.

<br>

## Statements

**The Application User states that:**

<br>

* the full responsibility of the Account and hereby all actions made is on the User. That means, in any possible case, the Author will not be accountable for loss
of any kind (please refer to the _License_ part above)

<br>

* the Account will be used only for its intended purpose - playing the game. Any other action that is beyond the mentioned purpose is strictly forbidden. That
being stated, User will NEVER use the Account for malicious intents, which may result in causing damages to the Application, the Author or the other User(-s)

<br>

* The Google Profile used to register does belong to the User, meaning that is not stolen, hacked or being abused by anyone else

<br>

## Prohibitions

**The Application User is NOT allowed to:**

<br>

* sell the Account or buy other Account(-s). An Account is considered a virtual property that cannot be exchanged for any real-world material value

* Account-botting the Application. Every User can set up one Account for a single e-mail address. Every suspicious Account, that do not meet that criteria
or is considered to be set up by a bot, will be terminated

* get unauthorized access to any other Account and its data that does not belong to the User

* use inappropiate or offensive usernames (currently each Account username is the exact same as the respective Google Profile name and surname)

* impersonate the Author or other User(-s)

* directly modifying, creating or deleting any Application property (excluding only the User Account)

* leaking, storing, abusing or manipulating any portion of data that is stored in the Application database

* directly modifying source code of the Application (exluding validated contributions)

* claiming the ownership of the Application or any of its content that does not belong directly to the User. The Application is copyrighted and further abusing
and claiming the others property as your own is illegal from law perspective

* threaten, harass and verbally abuse any other User or the Author

* make other actions, not mentioned above, that may cause damage to the Application, the Author or other User(-s)

<br>

## Account Permissions

<br>

**The Application User has such rights for his User Account:**

* request a username change - by contacting the Author by e-mail (xtheoryofcode@gmail.com). Any request where the suggested username is either inappropiate or
offensive will be rejected.

* request Account deletion - by contacting the Author by e-mail (xtheoryofcode@gmail.com). The User Account and all related data that is stored inside the
Application database will be irrevocably removed. Therefore, by the moment of Account deletion, the Terms of Service will no longer apply for the User,
until a new User Account is created.

* request Account unsuspension - by contacting the Author by e-mail (xtheoryofcode@gmail.com). The final decision is up to the Author, as each specific case
will be considered individually.

<br>

The request time for any Account related change does not represent a time, when the change applies. The Author reserves the right to make a requested change at
any given time. Hence there is no time specified for the Author for a change to be made.

<br>

## Privacy Policy Note

Upon registration, the following personal data is gathered from User's Google Profile:

* Name and surname

* E-mail address

* Profile image link

<br>

All of above data is mandatory to set up an Account. None of personal data is sold, transferred or manipulated for third parties or being used for any purposes
rather than for the Application to work properly. Furthermore, such data is not being used for marketing or analytics purposes.

Although such data is stored in a safe environment, there is no warrancy that a person with malicious intent might eventually access it by a means of database
leaks or hacking. The Application Author takes no responsibility for that cases and their possible outcomes.

<br>

## Terms of Services Modifications

The Author may revise these Terms of Services for the Application at any time without prior notice. By using this Application, you are agreeing to be bound by
the current version of these Terms and Services.

<br>

## Governing Law

Any claim related to the Author's Application shall be governed by the laws of Poland without regards to its conflict of law provisions.
